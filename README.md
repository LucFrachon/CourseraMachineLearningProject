# Human Activity Classification
Coursera Practical Machine Learning Project


This repo contains the final project for the John Hopkins University Practical Machine Learning course on Coursera.  
The .Rmd file is available to read the code.  
The compiled html file is viewable here: [http://lucfrachon.github.io/CourseraMachineLearningProject/]

The project aims at using sensor data to detect badly executed fitness moves.
Using data collected through accelerometers worn by a group of people performing weight lifting, we fit classification algorithms to the data to predict whether the exercise was performed correcty or with different types of typical errors.
